Python has become the go-to language for data science. This is due to the fact that Python has a number of libraries and frameworks that are well-suited for data science tasks, such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.

The popularity of Python for data science is also due to the fact that it is a relatively easy language to learn. This makes it a good choice for beginners who are interested in learning data science.
