In todays world of designing a data intensive application architecture we often mention words like `reliability`, `scalability`, `maintainability`.

This words are three main concerns that are important in most software systems so we need to define them what they actually mean, and how to apply each of them
to a specific software system.

In the following blog posts we are going to define them and show how they relate to the data of the software system.
