The Python Software Foundation has announced that Python 2.7 will reach end-of-life on January 1, 2020. This means that Python 2.7 will no longer receive security updates or bug fixes after that date.

The Python Software Foundation recommends that users migrate to Python 3.x as soon as possible. Python 3 is a newer version of Python that includes a number of improvements over Python 2.x.

For more information, see the [Python 2.7 end-of-life announcement](https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/).
