<p>Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because
they have such a profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also on
how we think about the problem that we are solving.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:
<ul>
<li>SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured schema to define the data model.</li>
<li>Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established through foreign keys.</li>
<li>SQL databases are suitable for structured data with well-defined relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:
<ul>
<li>NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, as well as scenarios where the data model is not predefined.</li>
<li>They offer more flexibility in terms of schema design, allowing you to work with data that can evolve over time.</li>
<li>NoSQL databases are categorized into several types, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graph Databases:
<ul>
<li>Graph databases are a specialized type of NoSQL database designed to handle data with complex relationships.</li>
<li>Data is represented as nodes, edges, and properties, making them ideal for modeling and querying connected data.</li>
<li>Graph databases excel in scenarios where the relationships between data points are as important as the data itself, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.</li>
<li>They are optimized for traversing and querying graph structures efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All three models (document, relational, and graph) are widely used today, and each is
good in its respective domain. One model can be emulated in terms of another
model - for example, graph data can be represented in a relational database
but the result is often awkward. That’s why we have different systems for different
purposes, not a single one-size-fits-all solution</p>
<p>Today, there are even newer ways to query data, for example GenBank which is a sequence
database specialized to perform sequence similarity searches, which means taking one
very long string (representing a DNA molecule) and matching it against a large database
of strings that are similar, but not identical.</p>
