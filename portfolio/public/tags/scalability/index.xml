      <description>this is a first post from a series of posts called Reliable, scalable and maintainable applications
ReliabilityLink to headingEverybody has an idea what this is:
application performs the function that the user expected it can tolerate the user making mistakes or using software in unexpected way its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume the system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse The things that can go wrong are called faults , and systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient.</description>

      <description>In todays world of designing a data intensive application architecture we often mention words like reliability, scalability, maintainability.
This words are three main concerns that are important in most software systems so we need to define them what they actually mean, and how to apply each of them to a specific software system.
In the following blog posts we are going to define them and show how they relate to the data of the software system.</description>
